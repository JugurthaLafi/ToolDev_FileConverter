Assignment description

Create an application for converting one file format (e.g. obj, xml, bmp) into another file format and vice versa (e.g. obj <-> xml, bmp<->xml).

The application needs to have an UI where an input file can be selected and where the converted file can be ‘saved as’ (supplying a method to choose a filename).

The resulting ‘saved as’ files should be re-usable as input and deliver the same data as the genuine file.
